- separate all input into two streams: suspicious activity / unsuspicious activity
  - e.g., likes too soon after a post, too many likes within a second, etc.
  - multiple stages with kafka intermediary
- describe reasons for suspicions to moderators?
  - "user wrote 10 suspicious posts within the last minute"...
- signatures of normal activity based on extracted features

  - potentially make use of active post statistics output
  - 1 Abnormal Account Activity: duration of activeness of a post -> mark outliers/above current 90% percentile
  - 1 Abnormal Account Activity: contents of text -> word count, etc.
  - 1 Abnormal Account Activity: timespan between events (i.e. likes)
  - 2 Ratio Of Engagements: many likes but few comments/replies indicative for buying likes?
  - 3 Followers Versus Engagements: many of the "likers" don't do much else?
  - 4 Follower Origin: too many users from same IP?
  - 6 Percentage Of Followers With Newly Created Accounts
    - number of interacting users with new accounts too high?
  - More post tags than usual? Friend count vs. activity?
  - Number of non-fraudulent activities?
    - count in split operator?
    - add count to event for suspicious stream?
  - Make use of window operator
    - Too many suspicious events within a window trigger report
  - ensemble approach, each feature given one vote, (majority) class is assigned

- warm-up period for initialization of averages
  - e.g., first 1000 events are not scanned for anomalies?
  - ...
- apply clustering algorithm?
  - generate clusters after warmup procedure?
  - might be hard with fake data?
